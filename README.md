# Student-Performance-Analysis-Prediction
# 🎯Objective: "🎓 Student Performance Analysis & Prediction 📊"

In this project I tried to understand how the student’s performance (test scores) is affected by other variables such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, and Lunch and Test preparation course. 

# Here are some key findings:
# 🔍 Dataset Description: 
The dataset comprised marks secured by high school students from the United States across various subjects, along with demographic and socioeconomic factors such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation.(Source: Kaggle)

# 📈 Univariate Analysis: 
Examining individual variables revealed intriguing patterns – most students attained grades B and C, with a significant proportion hailing from groups C and D. Moreover, parental education skewed towards college-level qualifications, and a higher percentage of females was observed in the dataset.

# 📊 Bivariate Analysis:
Delving deeper into the relationships between variables shed light on gender disparities in grade distribution, with females outperforming males in higher grades. Additionally, socioeconomic status and lunch type emerged as influential factors impacting academic performance.

# 💡 Multivariate Analysis:
By exploring interactions between multiple variables, nuanced insights emerged – completion of test preparation courses correlated positively with academic success, and students from affluent backgrounds exhibited higher average scores across subjects.

# 💡 Insights: 
• Majority of students received B grade followed by C. 
• More female students received A and B Grade relative to male students. 
• Students whose parents hold a master’s degree have a higher overall percentage.
• The percentage score of group E is highest among all the groups while the average of group A is lowest.
• Students who have completed their test preparations have definitely scored better
• Students who had the standard lunch have performed very well. Food and nutrition play a vital role in the growth of a student both, physically and academically. 
• most of the students score in between 60-80 in Maths whereas in reading and writing most of them score from 50-80. 

# 🤖 Model Training and Evaluation: 
Employing various regression models, including Linear Regression, Lasso, and Random Forest, I evaluated predictive performance metrics such as RMSE, MSE, MAE, and R2 scores. After rigorous evaluation, Linear Regression emerged as the optimal model, boasting impressive training and testing set R2 scores of 87.43% and 88.11%, respectively.

🚀 Armed with actionable insights, educational stakeholders can devise targeted interventions to foster student success and bridge achievement gaps.
